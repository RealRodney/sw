# Rules & Policies


---


# 1. General moderation

	**1.1. **At Stoneworks, we reserve the full right to limit the access to our servers, be it on Discord or on Minecraft. Rule violations that occur on Discord Servers related to ours, and in the Direct Messages or Group Chats of players whose relationship is primarily focused around Stoneworks and its happenings, will also be moderated.

**1.2. **Punishments for offences taking place on affiliated Discords may also befall the administration of the Discord in question, if sufficient evidence points to it having a culture of encouraging or overlooking toxicity and/or rules violations.

**1.3. **The use of personal beliefs in order to justify bigotry, or the breaking of any of the rules in this document, is not accepted as a valid excuse.

**1.4. **Using an alt on Discord or In-Game in order to circumvent/evade a punishment of any kind is disallowed.

**1.4.1** Knowingly aiding a player in evading a ban is disallowed

**1.4.2** Knowingly working for a ban-evading or banned nation leader (following political schemes, planning battles with them, orchestrating diplomatic talks under them, or gathering large amounts of materials for them) is disallowed. This will only be enforced with clear, direct evidence of **Individual(s) A** working directly with **Banned Individual(s) B** for high profile and prolonged cases, where the nation leader is banned for more than one month.

**1.5. **Spamming or posting unnecessary walls of text in any core Stoneworks chat, be it in-game or on Discord, is disallowed.

**1.6. **DMing someone with the purpose of advertising unrelated servers, products, or scam links is not allowed and will result in a ban.

**1.7. **Advertising other servers in any Stoneworks-related Discord or in-game is not allowed.

**1.8. **Channels for announcements (character or national) and channels for advertising your market, religion, or nation have **special rules **which are **pinned on the Discord, in the respective channels. **Failing to follow these rules will result in a punishment.

**1.9.** For ease of moderation, we only allow English to be used in Stoneworks public chats. Local chats are not included.

**1.10. **Banned/Muted players can only appeal for themselves via the means provided by the server, tickets/inquiries opened by different players about appealing these cases will be dismissed.


# 2. In-game and Discord Moderation Policies

**2.1. **Any infraction committed in the Stoneworks servers will be punished by staff accordingly. Staff _may_ accord lowered punishments for bans based on misinformation given by individual staff members. **All rules** **apply to all Minecraft servers of Stoneworks** (as of now, **but not limited to**, Rathnir, Eldham, Tremons, Hub, Practice).

**2.2. **Admins reserve the right to confiscate large amounts of items or money generated or obtained through methods that break the StoneWorks rules, such as glitches, illegal farms and theft.


# 3. Roleplaying licensing

**3.1. **Nothing created within the context of roleplay and politics on the Stoneworks Minecraft server or its affiliated fandom wiki is subject to copyright or licensing, within the bounds that the server and Stoneworks IP are owned by Jack from Stoneworks and Ra√∫l respectively.


# 4. Shop-related info


## 4.1. Perk transfer

**4.1.1. **Perks may be transferred **_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ONCE and ONLY</span>_** within 30 days of the initial purchase date. Make a ticket in the Stoneworks Discord to request this.


## 4.1. Custom brew recipe changes

**4.1.1. **Recipes may not be changed, unless the recipe has been clearly and evidentially stolen through an illegal exploit. Recipe change requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis.


## 4.2. Custom prefix limits

	**4.2.1. **You can only change your custom prefix every 30 days. Permissions for who can have access to your custom prefix can be changed once every 30 days. The Stoneworks Admin team reserves the right to deny the creation of any custom prefix, and request that the owner creates a different one.


## 4.3. Shop refund policy

	**4.3.1. **All purchases done through the Stoneworks store can be refunded within the first 2 weeks after the purchase. 


# 5. Application of Rules & Moderation Limits

**5.1. **Unless the offence has obvious social and/or legal ramifications, or the rules specifically states retroactive coverage, rules will not be retroactively applied to incidents they cover. 

**5.2.** Players who were the victims _and_ reporters of a rulebreak may lobby to have the ban reduced by the staff. If this is the case, staff may unban, reduce the ban time down to half its total, or down to two months total in the case of a permanent ban. This is based on the staff member‚Äôs sole discretion regarding the player, their offence, and previous offences. This also does not apply to bans for sexual harassment, doxxing, hacking, intense bigotry, blacklisted offences, or other extreme rule violations.

**5.3. **Staff also moderates all affiliated discords with Stoneworks. An affiliated discord is one which clearly meets 2 of the following criteria, without meeting either of the negative criteria:

_-Being named after a group that was started or is mainly in SW_

_-If the discord is advertised in the main server discord, particularly among nations, guilds, mercenary groups, character, religions, etc._

_-Having channels named for SW, SW groups, SW nations, or created for the usage of gameplay functions (like national announcements, maps, etc)_

_-Has roles, tiers, and ownership that reflects SW or a group in SW (ie, leader of an in game nation is the owner or top rank in discord, names of roles are the same as in game nations, etc)_

_-Links to the SW rulebook _

_-Has frequent announcements for events in game (wars, rituals, etc) _

_-Has emojis referencing SW_

WITHOUT having either of these two criteria:

_-Primarily made, moderated, and owned by people who do not currently or previously play on SW._

***NOTE** that is is NOT enough to simply claim it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot Stoneworks affiliated‚Äù etc.

	**5.3.1 **If a discord is affiliated by the above guidelines, but it is an edgecase and is arguably / very lightly affiliated, then staff can lower bantimes for rule violations in this discord at their own discretion.

	**5.4.** Staff will also monitor any conversations in Discord Direct Messages or Group Chats among Stoneworks players, as lots of toxicity and rulebreaks of the server occur here. 

	**5.5.** Staff will also moderate any conversations in any discord, affiliated or not, which clearly shows in their context that they are talking about Stoneworks (for example, Planning or executing wars and conflicts, specific players being annoying, groups that are prominent in game (even if they play other games together and you are referring to the people themselves), how people handled certain events, talking about people‚Äôs lore and characters, rules or moderation, etc). This should be clearly evident within the immediate context of the conversation via its language, content and references; and NOT based on player speculation of others‚Äô intentions or meaning. This context that links the rule violation to Stoneworks should be either within a few minutes from each other, within only a few continuous screenshots of each other, linked by replies, or directly referencing Stoneworks.

	**5.5.2** This also applies to Stoneworks-based content on Youtube, Twitch, Tiktok, etc. Content creators will not be moderated unless the potentially rule-breaking content itself is directly and clearly related to Stoneworks. This will only apply to very concrete and hardcore rulebreaks‚Äìnot toxicity or harassment.

**5.6.** Players are asked to submit evidence screenshots that are NOT cropped, but are fullscreen pictures of the conversation for more context.

**5.7.** Statute of Limitations for evidence- All bans and infractions, except for cases regarding sexual harassment of minors (pedophilia), doxxing, or real-life threats, are fully nullified and unusable after 6 weeks.

**5.8.** If you are the owner of an affiliated discord or are the leader of the nation/religion/faction of that discord, you must help us keep the community clean of the worst rule breakers. If you keep people in your discord who are banned for one of the big 3 rule breaks (doxxing, irl threats, pedophilia), then you will be held responsible with a severe ban if this banned player does one of these again to a SW player. 

This rule specifically applies only to if the discord owners and leaders are aware of these big-rule breakers‚Äô actions. In order for this rule to go into effect, there must be evidence that they knew of the banned players‚Äô misconduct, or they must be warned and told to ban the rule breakers by staff.

**5.8.1** This will be increased if the victimized SW player is in this discord or it happened in the discord. 

**5.8.2** This will also be an immediate permaban and blacklist if there is clear evidence of you as the discord owner encouraged these rule breaks.

**6.1.7. **Any players assisting others with Bandit, Mercenary, Pirate, or Bounty Hunter tags in the killing of other players without one of the three tags enabled is not allowed.

This does not apply in the Nether.

# 7. Plugin-related rules


## 7.1. Land rules

	These refer to the lands and nation claims created using the **Lands plugin**. These rules do not cover in-lore and in-RP countries and towns, which control an area beyond that which is claimed with the plugin (such an area is referred to as projected land). Staff will not look at in-lore and in-RP nations and countries for the application of land rules, pvp rules, or war rules.

**7.1.1. **In-real-life names or blatantly meme names may not be used as land or nation names. Admins reserve the right to rename lands deemed as breaking these rules. The main languages we will moderate real life names for are as follows: English, Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, French, Arabic, German and Japanese.

**7.1.2. **A land will be transferred to the second highest ranking person in it after its main owner has not been active for more than 30 days. Active is considered having more than 90 minutes of playtime within 30 days. Claim ownership can be given to a player if they are the only active person of their own rank and above. In case people higher or of the same rank were to be active in said claim they can ask for consent from said players to get it transferred. 

**7.1.3. **A land claim may be deleted after none of its members have been active for the past 30 days. A regular land claim member will be considered inactive if they have less than 90 minutes of playtime within the last 30 days. A land claim can be deleted for inactivity if all members within the land reach inactivity, regardless of the land owners‚Äô punishment length.** **

**7.1.4. **Land claims are seen as the property of the single owner of the land claim. They have the right to do what they wish with their property, except the theft rules laid out in section.

**7.1.5. **Claim ownership can be given to a player if they are the only active person of their own rank and above. In case people higher or of the same rank were to be active in said claim they can ask for consent from said players to get it transferred. This only applies to players that do not own any other lands at that time.

**7.1.6** Using large amounts of alts (roughly 3+) in order to increase the size of a land claim, particularly for political advantages and land-agitation, is disallowed.

**7.1.7** Players **are** allowed to take over land claims using land's internal mechanics (such as betrayal by a land's admin by unclaiming or kicking players from it). However, doing this land coup with an alt is not allowed, nor is doing so to steal player property, or to avert war results. If the land coup is done and breaks these rules, it will be reversed.


## 7.2 Proxy Claiming

**7.2** Using land claims and claimed chunks as a geopolitical tool in and of themselves is not allowed. Players are expected to only use claims to protect developed lands and their infrastructure. A claim that is over 2 weeks old will not be considered a proxy claim unless it is changed to fulfill one of the examples below. Proxy rules do apply unless the nation does not have in-game claims. Ownership of a land claim can be used as a political tool. If the changes to the claim are maintained and go unreported for 2 weeks, it will not be considered a proxy claim.

Once a nation leader reports a claim and has it deleted, this cannot be reversed at the nation leader‚Äôs request‚Äìmake sure to communicate with your nation members about new claims. Things will be reversed if they are due to staff fault or miscommunication.

These usages of land claims are **NOT** allowed:

**7.2.1** <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Proxy claims:</span> creating a new land claim which lacks loot, development, or significance from which you declare war. This is done to avoid stakes and damages to your real town claims.

**7.2.2** <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Invasive claims*:</span> Nonconsensually creating a new land claim on another nation‚Äôs land for example to agitate them into war or diplomatic settlement. This does not include a nation‚Äôs internal rebellions, coups, secessions, land/ownership disagreements, or newbie player squatters, these exceptions only apply to claims older than 2 weeks, which were in the nation. New claims are not allowed to be created in disputed areas.

_*Reports against this land claim should ONLY come from a nation‚Äôs top leader._

**7.2.3** <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Siege claims:</span> creating a new land claim nearby to the battle that is useful because it is not declared war upon. This is done for the purpose of making the attacking or defending position more difficult (surrounding the defending land claim, protecting bases for respawn beds and loot stores, fracturing one land claim into several to make a battle less impactful, etc).

**7.2.4 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Snaking or Blocking claims:</span> **making a claim to encircle another claim or expanding an existing claim to encircle another claim. This also includes making or expanding a claim that intentionally blocks other claims from expanding. This does not apply to simple claim borders, but unreasonably extending your claim to block off others or branches out to secure an overly large plot of land.

**7.2.5 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Insurgent claims:</span>** creating new claims to cement a rebellion. In cases of rebellions and turmoil, claims must stay the same or be altered only by uninvolved third parties.

These usages of land claims in geopolitics **ARE** allowed:



* Taking over land claims using siege rules
* Trading land claims, even if the owner does not consent
* Using land claims as bases
* Launching insurrections, coups, and secessions from land claims
* Extending land claims to protect roads, walls, outposts, etc. that do not interfere with other claims 
* Extend land claims beyond map or nation borders (so long as they don‚Äôt violate the kinds of proxy claims)
* Take over land claims using land's internal mechanics (see rule Land Rule** 7.1.7**)


## 7.3. Scamming rules

Using any plugin on the server to scam other players is not allowed. This includes, **but is not limited to**:

**7.3.1. **Using the chest shop plugin to create shop chests that sell another item than what you say they sell.

	**7.3.2.** Using plugins to trade or sell items that have been renamed to look like another, more valuable, item.

	**7.3.3.** Using /rename, /lore and /setloreline to create items that look like they have enchantments that they don‚Äôt actually have. Creating ‚Äúfake enchantments‚Äù is still allowed, as long as the enchantment has a different base colour than grey, or it doesn‚Äôt have the same name as any of the enchantments in vanilla Minecraft and you don‚Äôt claim that it is a real enchantment.

**7.2.4.** Scamming new or returning players. Forcing them to apply the bandit prefix, threatening them to join the nether, etc. 


## 7.4. Naming of an item/land.

	**7.4.1 **Renaming an item (via plugin or anvil) so that it breaks any of the Stoneworks rules will result in a punishment equivalent to having spoken/typed it.

	**7.4.2 **Utilising the Lore plugin to write words that break the Stoneworks rules will result in a punishment as explained in the rule above.

	**7.4.3 **Creating/Renaming a land so that it includes words that break the server rules will result in the corresponding punishment as stated above.


# 8. Griefing & Structure rules

Griefing is defined as the destruction or construction of disruptive structures on a large scale. Cases of griefing are dealt with depending on the size and effect of such disruptive structures. Killing **ANY** animals in a claimed area will count as griefing.

**8.1.6. **Extreme resource collection can be counted as griefing, based on staff discretion.

**8.1.7. **Grief that is older than 30 days will not be moderated.

	**8.2.5.** Use of bunkers made out of unexplodable blocks (water, lava, waterlogged blocks, etc.) that cannot be broken during wars. Blocks that can be broken during wars (such as obsidian) are allowed.


    **8.2.6.** Buttons, levers, signs, string and campfires are not to be used for traps.

This list may be amended in the future, should any other factions' base elements be discovered. In such cases, the base may still be considered a faction's base, even if the specific factions-style tactic in use isn‚Äôt on this list yet. Wars involving faction bases may lead to nullification, warnings, or temp-bans of their leaders.


    **8.2.7. **Feet Grinders aren‚Äôt allowed; this is traps where a players feet are hit while they aren‚Äôt able to hit back and often where they‚Äôre trapped in and can‚Äôt escape. This means players can‚Äôt be trapped at the bottom of a fall trap and have their feet hit while they‚Äôre trapped. Fall traps must also be 2x2 blocks wide or larger. 


## 8.3. Inappropriate build rules

**8.3.2. **Players are not allowed to build swastikas under any circumstances.

**9.7. **Theft that is older than 30 days will not be moderated.


# 10. War rules


---

War rules are a special set of rules that apply to **land wars **(battles using the plugin). Though they once appeared on the rulebook, redundancy and having two documents made it so they were sometimes conflicting. All of the war rules were moved to the document which you can find below.

**To read the War Rulebook, [CLICK HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nkoV5U6rN1gOaWQrYJl-Q16yS9BsLju2Wbosfo7mU34/edit)**

Toxicity is considered to be a set of behaviours done with the intent or effect, willing or not, of insulting, belittling, threatening, or otherwise creating a negative impact and experience for other people. Wishing to establish a welcoming and safe environment for all, staff will regulate toxicity within the server.


## 13.1. General toxicity rules

**13.1.1** Excessively hostile language is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, telling someone to die or commit suicide, bringing up trauma in a demeaning way, encouraging or justifying bullying, and demeaning others through mental, physical, or developmental disorders.


    **13.1.1.1** Any variation of "kys‚Äù, including phrases such as "keep yourself safe", are not allowed on Stoneworks. Attempts to loophole rule 13.1.1 will be punished.

**13.1.2** Repeated insulting, gloating, or mockery is not allowed. Repeated insults (regarding for example- people‚Äôs intelligence, toughness, or whether or not people like them), especially in a noticeably vitriolic, angry, and profane way is not allowed.

	**13.1.3. **The comparison of another individual or group of people to totalitarian, genocidal, or dictatorial regimes is strictly disallowed in Stoneworks.

	**13.1.4. **The use of personal beliefs in order to justify bigotry, or the breaking of any of the rules in this document, is not accepted as a valid excuse.

	**13.1.5. **Players are asked to cut contact with other players that are constantly insulting and entering in conflict with them. This can be done through discord blocks and the use of /ignore.

	**13.1.6. **Should a player be found continuing to target and harass another, they will be punished accordingly.

	**13.1.7. **Targeting a player or group of players through the means of wars, raiding, minor griefing or more than once in a 7 day period is harassment. **This does not apply in the Nether. **Griefing or destruction of Stoneworks Affiliated Discords is not allowed and will be considered harassment. 

**	13.1.7.1 **Raiding is any attack on land claim, be it against players trusted in it or not. The raiding area includes the extra three unclaimed chunks beyond the perimeters of the claim. The raid concludes after the raider/s exit the raiding area. (Entering the claim geared along raiders, but not fighting, will still be considered a raid).

**13.1.8** Calling someone and condemning them as, **but not limited to**, fascist, nazi, racist (this one particularly requires lots of evidence of toxicity).

13.2. Bigotry rules 

**13.2.1. **No blatant/insensitive discrimination or comments based on race, gender, sexuality or religion.

**13.2.2. **The use of derogatory slurs in Stoneworks is disallowed as per staff discretion.

**13.2.3. **Impersonating minorities in Stoneworks is punishable.

**13.2.4. **Hard slurs (words whose main or only usage is derogatory against a group of people) are bannable. 

**13.2.5. **Soft slurs (words that are not necessarily derogatory, but can still be charged with offensive intent) will be punished depending on context. Soft slurs with clear derogatory intent will be punished as if they were hard slurs.

**13.2.6.** If you are saying derogatory things about SW players in relation to Stoneworks or because of events (Wars, Geopol etc) on Stoneworks you will get banned. 


## 13.3. Edginess & Political discussion rules

‚ÄúEdgy‚Äù is understood as anything that glorifies or makes humour out of the holocaust, slavery, manmade famines, September 11th, political torture, pedophilia, the AIDS epidemic, domestic abuse, antisemitic conspiracy theories, descriptive gore, mental health issues, and other sensitive topics. It also extends to anything that mocks ethnicities, minorities, gender identity, etc.

**13.3.1.** Needlessly edgy statements, jokes, memes and language are not allowed on Stoneworks.

**13.3.2. **Staff reserves the right to shut down any discussions involving edgy topics.

**13.3.3. **Political discussion relating to in-real-life issues is discouraged on Stoneworks. Staff reserves the right to shut down political discussions, especially in cases where it could be considered that the discussion will devolve into toxicity or edginess. The same extends to discussions on in-real-life religions.

**13.3.5.** Denial, apologia, or whitewashing of relevant and widely recognized historical atrocities, genocides, manmade famines, and human rights violations will not be tolerated. 


        **13.3.5.1.** Players are allowed to engage in honest and good faith discussion of these events, so long as it does not devolve into apologetical dismissal or glorification of their perpetrators, or otherwise validation.


        **13.3.5.2.** This extends, **but is not limited to**, the Holocaust, the Holodomor, crimes against Native Americans, colonial atrocities, Armenian genocide, Rwandan genocide, atrocities perpetrated by Imperial Japan, Soviet purges & manmade famines, Bengali famine, enslavement & genocide of Black Americans, the Khmer Rouge, etc.


## 13.4 Targeted Bans & Ban Weaponization

**13.4.1** War Banning- it is not allowed to withhold evidence in order to get a player banned at a convenient time surrounding wars. If this is clearly shown through a player reporting evidence that is 2+ weeks old and within a reasonable period of a scheduled lands war involving these two players, the reporting player may be banned.

**13.4.2** Ban Folders- Keeping folders to store and categorize massive amounts of evidence in order to pull out when it is advantageous is not allowed. This is scummy metagaming. This is only bannable with evidence of a dedicated ban folder, not player testament alone. This does not apply if someone is building a case for recent toxicity against a specific player.

**13.4.3 **Ban Wars- It is not allowed to report someone as an in-game tool, aka starting a ‚Äúban war‚Äù. Any evidence that directly shows players intending to use bans as a weapon in a conflict, starting a ban war, use blackmail of evidence in order to influence in game events, etc., will result in this player being banned, and may lead to a reduction in the original reported ban based on staff discretion. This does not apply based on the timing or speculated motivation of a report alone, and must be based on clear and direct evidence.

14. Sexual interaction rules

Interactions or comments of sexual and erotic nature are not permitted in Stoneworks. This extends to all core Stoneworks servers, as well as related Discord servers. It‚Äôs important to note that **sexual interaction rules regarding minors (pedophilia) do not abide by the statute of limitations!** This is all for the safety of our community.


## 14.1. Sexual harassment

	**14.1.1. **DMing another player unsolicited messages of sexual or suggestive content will be punished.

	**14.1.2. **Sexual, erotic, and graphic comments in public chats will be punished.

	**14.1.3. **Inappropriate comments towards someone, especially **but not limited to** if they show discomfort, will be punished.

	**14.1.4. **Breaking the above will be punished harsher should the person be a minor.

	**14.1.5. **Sexual activity between inappropriately aged players will result in a ban.

	**14.1.6. **Inciting or fabricating sexual harassment allegations will be punished.

	**14.1.7. **Reaching out or seeking sexual interaction as a minor is punishable. Lying about your age in these circumstances is also punishable.

**14.1.8.** Paedophilia, grooming or sexual harassment of any kind will fall under Illicit behaviour will result in a ban.

**Addendum: **If you are a minor (under 18 or the age of consent in your country) and another player asks to meet you in person, please contact staff immediately.

**Addendum:** Any evidence of low level sexual harassment or solicitation will be taken much more seriously (with a lower threshold of evidence and no plausible deniability) if the violating player has a history of these activities in our community. This includes calling others mommy/daddy, referring to sex positions and preferences, fixating on relationships and sexual activity, becoming upset at changes from sexual topics, etc.


## 14.2. Sexual Roleplay & Interactions

	**14.2.1. **Erotic Roleplay is not allowed anywhere within the Stoneworks Community.

	**14.2.2. **Discords related to Stoneworks are not allowed to have channels dedicated to NSFW interactions.

## 15.2. Staff abuse rules

Staff members are not exempt from any of the rules.

	**15.2.1.** Staff are not to use their in game permissions for non-staff related activities that affect other players.

	**15.2.2.** Staff are not to use their permissions in Discord to obstruct communication of other community members without a valid reason.

	**15.2.4.** Applying a punishment with a clear disregard to Statute of Limitations or other internal staff guidelines is considered staff abuse.

	**15.2.5.** Using staff permissions or accessibility to perform a staff action without sufficient evidence or for personal gain is considered staff abuse.

	**15.2.6. **Administrators are not allowed to engage in geopolitics, specifically:


        **15.2.6.1. **They may not lead any nations or countries (independent entities whose projected land is represented on the world maps)


        **15.2.6.2 **They may not engage in diplomacy (be it by signing documents, negotiating, etc).

# 16. Discord Rules

Specific rules on the usage of nation/religion/market advertisement in the channels reserved for it on the Stoneworks Main Discord may be found on the messages that are pinned.


    **16.1.1.** DM Advertising is never allowed. This refers to sending unsolicited links to join a Stoneworks nation, discord server, group, community, or movement, etc.


    **16.1.2.** DM raiding is never allowed. This is defined as sending links for people to spam and troll a discord community with disallowed language, harassment, or content. The severity of the ban will reflect the offences which occurred in the raid.


    **16.1.3.** Scam links/advertising anywhere in the Stoneworks Community will result in a permanent discord and ingame ban.


    **16.1.4.** Advertising any non Stoneworks content in the main discord is not allowed.

    By playing on our Minecraft server or engaging with our discord servers or affiliated discords run by private individuals, you agree to the potential condition of being recorded without your knowledge or explicit consent on voice and video calls by either server staff or individuals playing the game, as this is a common happening on discord and the game server. While recording someone without their consent is considered illegal in 11/50 states in the US, the acceptance and use of this video/voice evidence is an important part of our rule enforcement system to keep hate speech, harassment, and trolls off of our platforms. We expect people maintain each other's privacy, but will accept any rulebreaking evidence that is obtained in this way.


    This does not apply to any cases of sexual harassment, bullying, blackmail, doxxing, real life extortion, or any other contents and misuse of these recordings that are already punishable by server rules.

Any evidence of this must require the blackmailer using the evidence as a way to get what they want, or threatening to leak or report for it.

# Detailed Stoneworks Ban Times List

Stoneworks Ban Times work by stacking with each offence in the same category. The category is marked by the first number at the start of a rule. For example a rulebreak in toxicity goes up a tier with any other toxicity rulebreak. In the case someone breaks multiple rules across a range of rules the first offence ban times are simply added together. 



* Stoneworks has a tiered ban time system the more offences in one category the higher ban time you will receive for another offence in that category 
* If rulebreaks are not in the same category they are added together. 
* Admin discretion may be used depending on the context of the situation to alter ban times however this should only be used in very unique circumstances.

# Rings of Power System

Rings of Power are digital tokens that players can usr to enact special powers. They come in the form of a discord role. They are obtained by independently completing roleplay and world building events and storylines, and are handed out by the server owners. The Rings of Power themselves have two tiers, the more powerful and rarer Gold Rings of Power, and the more common Silver Rings of Power


## How to Obtain Rings of Power

Players get these by organizing and executing roleplay events and storylines in-game without significant admin help. Players must show these events (via recordings) to the owners, who are the _only_ ones who can award the Rings. Players will NOT get these just by writing lore or by hosting an adhoc event that clearly wishes to gain benefits without the effort or serious roleplay. Golden Rings should be given out at a rate of 1-2 per month, and Silver Rings should be given out at a rate of 5-6 per month. 

For a good example of a Golden Ring of Power worthy storyline, see the following video section‚Äì[The Anglunian Neihernspried Crisis](https://youtu.be/xZypOeTq5oY?t=474) (dozens of players, character-based, long term, lore based, little to no admin intervention).

For Silver Rings of Power, see the following video‚Äì[Archaeology Roleplay Event](https://youtu.be/dqTXiPhNCfc?t=31) (about a dozen players, character-based, draws on past lore, though** ignore all the admin intervention**!!!)

Only one Ring may be given out per player event, unless it‚Äôs a massive RP war or a very large server-wide event, then 2 Rings may be handed out. Players should take clear ownership and credit of their events from the outset. 

These player events and storylines must generally:



* Be relatively serious, purposeful, and RP toned
* Be noticeably effortful, passionate, social, and well prepared. There should be large builds or areas constructed for this event.
* Be based on lore and adhere to the unique culture of a nation, religion, or group
* Be well-intentioned  for the sake of Roleplay and creative expression in game
* Have a significant number of people (rough minimum of 10 for silver rings, 20 for golden)
* Be well-received by the players in attendance
* Not be significantly assisted by staff in organization or execution (spawning a few mobs or setting a warp are okay levels of intervention)
* (for Golden rings) not be a simple party, pvp tournament, or sports contest.

# Staff Ethics & Procedure


---

**Fairness & Rule Application**



* Staff must apply rules equally based on how they are written and the spirit of their purpose.
* Staff must not handle tickets or situations that they are directly involved in. They are expected to report evidence and let another staff member handle it.
* If there is confusion in interpretation of the rules, staff should consult other staff members, with higher staff members‚Äô interpretation of the rules weighing more.
* Staff must operate off of substantial evidence when punishing a player or interfering with in game politics or mechanics.
* Staff should hear both sides of an argument during bans and appeals. When not maintaining anonymity of the reporting player, they must add accused players when more information is necessary for this (proxy claim tickets, toxicity bans, war tickets, etc.)
* Staff must give player reports and accusations serious and due consideration.
* Staff must not give players items or advantages in game, except in a limited Roleplay context.

**Staff Standards**



* Staff must maintain anonymity of players who request it in a ticket.
* Staff must not leak tickets or staff-only chats unless given permission by those involved.
* Staff must maintain a higher level of respectability, adherence to the rules, and calm demeanor than is expected of players. 
* Staff must be reasonably active in game and in discord moderation or policy discussions in order to keep their position.

**Checks & Balances on Staff**



* Owners can override rules and punishments if a case is reasonably seen to have staff bias, unfair application of rules, exceptional circumstances, procedural errors, etc.
* Owners are expected to carry out periodic waves of mass unbans that may be punitive, unfair, biased; or reasonably unban people who may be beneficial to the server‚Äôs gameplay and longevity.

**Staff Demotion or Retirement**



* Staff can be demoted due to rule infractions, misconduct, or violation of our standards and ethics both inside and outside our server.
* Staff who were active and impactful admins for a considerable amount of time, and left the team on good terms, will be given the in-game rank of netherite.
